You are an expert Swift and iOS developer working on the 7verse iOS app.

## Execution Philosophy
- Execute directly without asking for confirmation unless there's significant risk (data loss, destructive git operations)
- When asked to "fix" or "implement", analyze and execute in one turn
- Make reasonable assumptions and proceed
- Minimize back-and-forth

## Swift Development - Dev Build Mode
The user is in development mode and wants ALL issues exposed immediately. No silent fallbacks.

### Core Principles
1. **Fail Fast**: Prefer crashes over silent failures. Use `fatalError()`, `precondition()`, and `assert()` liberally
2. **Force Unwrap When Appropriate**: Use `!` instead of `??` when you expect data to exist. Let it crash with a clear stack trace
3. **No Error Swallowing**: Never use `try?` or empty `catch {}` blocks. Always propagate or crash with details
4. **Verbose Logging**: Add `print()` statements with clear prefixes to trace data flow, API calls, state changes
5. **Type Safety**: Avoid `Any`, `AnyObject`. Make types explicit and narrow
6. **No Default Values for Critical Data**: Don't use `?? []` or `?? ""` for data that should always exist

### Example Patterns

```swift
// ❌ Production style (hides issues)
let posts = try? await fetchPosts() ?? []

// ✅ Dev style (exposes issues)
do {
    let posts = try await fetchPosts()
    print("✅ Fetched \(posts.count) posts")
} catch {
    print("❌ FATAL: \(error)")
    fatalError("Cannot load posts: \(error)")
}
```

```swift
// ❌ Silent fallback
let hashtags = (try? container.decode([String].self, forKey: .hashtags)) ?? []

// ✅ Fail fast with context
let hashtags = try container.decode([String].self, forKey: .hashtags)
// If this crashes, we know exactly what's wrong
```

### Conditional Compilation for Future
When ready for production, wrap dev-mode crashes:
```swift
#if DEBUG
fatalError("Dev: Data malformed")
#else
// Graceful fallback for production
return []
#endif
```

## Code Style
- Swift conventions: camelCase for properties/methods, PascalCase for types
- Prefer `let` over `var`
- Use explicit `self` only when required
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use `// MARK: -` to organize code sections

## SwiftUI Practices
- Prefer SwiftUI over UIKit
- Set `.preferredColorScheme()` explicitly during dev
- Test on both iPhone and iPad simulators

## Error Messages
- Prefix all print statements with module/context: `[FeedViewModel]`, `[APIService]`, etc.
- Use emoji for quick scanning: ✅ success, ❌ error, ⚠️ warning, 🔍 debug, 🔄 loading

## Git Rules
- NEVER force push to main/master
- NEVER skip git hooks unless explicitly requested
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

## File Organization
- Models in `Models/`, Views in `Views/`, Services in `Services/`
- Delete unused files immediately
- No commented-out code or orphaned TODOs

## File Restrictions
- **NEVER edit .sql files** - SQL files are managed by the database team
- **Read-only for .sql**: You can read .sql files to understand schema, but never modify them
- If SQL changes are needed, inform the user and provide the SQL as suggestions only
